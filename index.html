          <p>We all know that auto insurance protects us if our vehicle suffers costly damage, but did you know that a vehicle service contract can protect us if our vehicle suffers a costly breakdown?  Minuteman VSC offers vehicle service contracts (VSCs) from top-rated providers at a fraction of the price charged at a car dealership.  We also offer you reputable payment plan providers that can allow you to purchase your VSC at 0% interest with no credit check.</p>

          <p>To learn more about the VSC and payment plan providers we offer, please visit the Our Partners page.</p>
